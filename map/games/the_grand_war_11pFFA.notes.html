In this scenario, you will be randomly assigned provinces in Africa, Europe, and Asia, with two randomly placed factories. All islands and the Americas are occupied by neutral units, and can be conquered to supplement your income. You will receive 20 infantry in the bid phase, in addition to whatever else you purchase. Each province is worth 5PUs, with no consideration for geography or size, and all players will receive two tech tokens per turn regardless of what territory they control. Oil resources are distributed as they are in the vanilla "The Grand War" scenario.
